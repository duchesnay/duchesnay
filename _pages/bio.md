Since 2008, I am a permanent researcher working at NeuroSpin: a MRI neuroimaging center within the CEA. I am developing machine learning algorithms (classification/regression) and multivariate/univariate statistics analysis tools. My aim is to design algorithms that provide computer-aided diagnosis/prognosis tools or biomarkers discovering methods for brain diseases. I am now integrating genetic (DNA array) together with neuroimaging. The specificity of those data is their large dimensionality in both neuroimaging and genetic (~millions of measurements) compared to the low number of samples (~hundreds). Thus, the guiding thread of all my research is to design feature extraction/selection, sparse and structured machine learning (convex optimisation) algorithms.

I received the engineer degree in software engineering from École Pour l’Informatique et les Techniques Avancées (France) in 1997, the M.Sc. degree in signal/image processing from Rennes 1 University (France) in 1998 and the PhD degree in signal and image processing Rennes 1 University (France) in 2001.
